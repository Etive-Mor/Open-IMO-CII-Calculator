# Open IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) Calculator ðŸš¢

## What is this?

An unofficial open source implementation of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)'s Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). 

The CII indicator aims to make the carbon intensity of any given ship easy to understand, transparent, and standardised. It does so by ranking all ships globally on an A to E rating (A being the best, E being the worst). Ship emission intensity calculations consider a mixture of weight, distance travelled in the calendar year, and the fuel used in their main engines (for a comprehensive explanation, see the [methodology section](#methodology)). 

Grades are re-calculated annually. The boundaries of what is considered "good" is a moving target, described in [table 4](#table-4-annual-carbon-reduction-factors-z). This moving target is intended to encourage shipping firms to constantly improve the carbon intensity of their ships to 2030.

The specification for this software can be found in [IMO's resolution MEPC.353(78)](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/MEPCDocuments/MEPC.353(78).pdf), adopted in June 2021.

# Methodology

A ship's Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) is measured by calculating its transport workload in a given calendar year, then calculating the mass of $CO_2$ produced by the ship in that year. The ship's *Attained CII* is the product of its $transportWork$ and the $massOfCO_2Emissions$ in one calendar year.

> $AttainedCII = massOfCo2Emissions \times transportWork$

Ships are split into 12 categories, for example "Bulk Carrier", "Tanker", "Cruise Passenger Ship" among others (see [Table 1](#table-1-mepc33776---shipping-capacity-tables) for a comprehensive list). A ship is compared internally among its category peers but never across categories, for example, a *Bulk Carrier* is not directly comparable to a *LNG Carrier* in this system.


**Inputs**
- The type of ship
- The type of fuel used by the ship's main engine 
- The capacity of the ship, measured in either Deadweight Tonnage (DWT) or Gross Tonnage (GT)
- The distance travelled by the ship in one calendar year, measured in nautical miles

The ship's *Attained CII* is then compared to its *Required CII* to produce an easy to understand grade for the ship. The grading scheme is in the range A to E, where A is the most efficient bracket, C represents a ship at-or-near its CII, and E is the least efficient. 

| Grade |  Description |
| ----- | ---- |
| A |   CII below the *Superior Boundary* |
| B |   CII above the *Superior Boundary* and below the *Lower Boundary* |
| C |   CII between the *Lower Boundary* and the *Upper Boundary* |
| D |   CII above the *Upper Boundary* and below the *Inferior Boundary* |
| E |   CII above the *Inferior Boundary* |

*Fig1.* IMO Boundaries, after [IMO MEPC.354(78)](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/MEPCDocuments/MEPC.354(78).pdf)


## Ship Grade Ratio Methodology

A ship's grade is calculated by comparing its ***Attained CII*** to its ***Required CII*** to give its performance $A/R$ ratio. If the ship's $A/R$ ratio falls below the boundary for its class of [Ship Type](#table-3-mepc33976---ship-grading-boundaries), it attains a higher (better) grade.  Boundaries are calculated as:

> $shipTypeRequiredCII \times exp(d_i)$. 

### Ship Grade Worked example
The worked example below considers a *Bulk Carrier*, with a Deadweight Tonnage below 279,000. Assuming the *Bulk Carrier*'s $required CII$ is:


> $10g CO_2 / DWT.NM$

> [!IMPORTANT]
For some ship types, $GT \times NM$ should be used instead of $DWT \times NM$, see [Table 1](#table-1-mepc33776---shipping-capacity-tables) and [transport work done methodology](#ship-transport-work-methodology) for a comprehensive guide. 

Then the boundaries are calculated with:
 
- $10 \times exp(d1)$
- $10 \times exp(d2)$
- $10 \times exp(d3)$
- $10 \times exp(d4)$. 

The $exp(d_i)$ rating boundaries for each ship type can be found in [Table 3](#table-3-mepc33976---ship-grading-boundaries). The resultant boundaries for the *Bulk Carrier* in question are:

| Boundary Type | Required CII | Boundary's Lower Threshold |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Superior      | $= 10 \times exp(d1)$ <br /> $= 10 \times 0.86$<br />  $= 8.6$ |  $8.6 gCO_2/transportWork$ |
| Lower         | $= 10 \times exp(d2)$ <br /> $= 10 \times 0.94$<br />  $= 9.4$ |  $9.4 gCO_2/transportWork$ |
| Upper         | $= 10 \times exp(d3)$ <br /> $= 10 \times 1.06$<br />  $= 10.6$ | $10.6 gCO_2/transportWork$ |
| Inferior      | $= 10 \times exp(d4)$ <br /> $= 10 \times 1.18$<br />  $= 11.8$ | $11.8 gCO_2/transportWork$ |


Grades are then derived from these boundaries, by comparing the ship's *Attained CII* to the thresholds across a given calendar year:


| Grade | Higher than | Lower than | Description |
| ----- | :----: | :----: | ---- |
| A |  | 8.6 | Below *Superior Boundary* |
| B |  8.6 | 9.4 | Above *Superior Boundary*,<br />Below  *Lower Boundary* |
| C |  9.4 | 10.6 | Above *Lower Boundary*,<br />Below  *Upper Boundary* |
| D |  10.6 | 11.8 | Above *Upper Boundary*,<br />Below  *Inferior Boundary* |
| E |  11.8 | | Above *Inferior Boundary* |

**Example Results**:

- If the ship's *Attained CII* was $9gCO_2/ DWT \times NM$, the ship receives a grade `B`, as its *Attained CII* was above the threshold for *Superior Boundary*, but below the threshold for *Lower Boundary*.
- If the ship's *Attained CII* was $11gCO_2/ DWT \times NM$, the ship receives a grade `D`, as its *Attained CII* was above the threshold for *Upper Boundary*, but below the threshold for *Inferior Boundary*.

## Ship Attained Carbon Intensity Methodology

A ship's Attained carbon intensity is calculated by taking the [mass of its aggregate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions](#ship-co_2-emissions-methodology) in a calendar year, and multiplying it by its [transport work done](#ship-transport-work-methodology) in the calendar year.

> $massOfCo2Emissions \times transportWork$

**Method accepts**:
- `massOfCo2Emissions`, the mass of $CO_2$ emissions in the calendar year 
    - See [co2 emissions methodology](#ship-co_2-emissions-methodology) to calculate
- `transportWork`, the work carried out by the ship in the calendar year
    - See [transport work methodology](#ship-transport-work-methodology) to calculate

**Method Returns**:
- A `double` representing the ship's *Attained Carbon Intensity*

**Implementation**:

Returns the product of a ship's mass of $CO_2$ emissions and its $transportWork$.



## Ship transport work methodology

A ship's transport work is calculated by taking its [capacity](#ship-capacity-methodology) and multiplying it by the distance sailed in nautical miles in the calendar year. 

> $capacity \times distanceSailed$

**Method accepts**:
- `capacity` the ship's capacity for cargo or passengers
    - See [ship capacity methodology](#ship-capacity-methodology) to calculate
-  `distanceSailed` the distance sailed in Nautical Miles in the calendar year


**Implementation**:

Returns the product of a ship's capacity and its distance sailed

## Ship CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Methodology

The sum of a ship's $CO_2$ emissions over a given year are calculated by multiplying the mass of consumed fuel by the fuel's emissions factor. 

**Method Accepts**:
- `fuelType`, an enum derrived from [Table 2](#table-2-mepc36479-mass-conversion-between-fuel-consumption-and-co_2-emissions)'s *Fuel Type* column
- `fuelConsumptionMass`, a `double` representing the mass of fuel consumed in grams (g) over the given year


**Method Returns**:

- A `double` representing the $M$ mass of $CO_2$ emitted by the ship across one calendar year

**Implementation**:

The sum of $CO_2$ emissions $M$ from fuel consumption in a given calendar year is 

> $M = FC_j \times C_{f_j}$

Where: 
- $j$ is the fuel type
- $FC_j$ is the mass in grams of the consumed fuel type `j` in one calendar year
- $C_{f_j}$ is the fuel oil mass to CO2 mass conversion factor, given in Table 2's $C_F$ column



## Ship Capacity Methodology

A ship's capacity is measured by either its Deadweight Tonnage (DWT) or Gross Tonnage (GT). The only exception is `Bulk Carriers`, which have a capacity capped at 279,000. 

To calculate a ship's Capacity in accordance with the IMO's MEPC353(78) guidelines:

**Method accepts**:
- `shipType`, an enum, derrived from *Table 1*'s *Ship Type* column
- `deadweightTonnage`, the *deadweight tonnage* of the ship, provided in long tons
- `grossTonnage`, the *gross tonnage* of the ship, provided in long tons

**Method returns**:
- a `double` representing the ship's capacity in imperial *long tons*

**Implementation**:

$Capacity$ of a given ship is calculated using the following rules:

- If the ship is a `Bulk Carrier`, and its DWT is 279,000 or above, its capacity is capped at 279,000
- If the ship is a `Bulk Carrier`, and its DWT is below 279,000, its capacity is equal to its DWT
- If the ship is a `Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)`, a `Ro-ro passenger ship` or a `Cruise passenger ship`, its capacity is equal to its Gross Tonnage
- Otherwise, the ships capacity is equal to its DWT

The full implementation detail can be found in **[Table 1](#table-1-mepc33776-shipping-capacity)**'s *Ship Type*, *Ship weight*, and *Capacity* columns.

**Exceptions**:

- `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown if the DWT is set to 0, when ship type is set to anything other than `Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)`, `Ro-ro passenger ship` or `Cruise passenger ship`
- `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown if the GT is set to 0, when ship type is set to `Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)`, `Ro-ro passenger ship` or `Cruise passenger ship`

## Table 5: Common shipping measurement conversions

Often in shipping, non-metric measurements are used. Conversions are detailed below

| Measure | Metric Measure | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Deadweight Tonne (DWT) | $1016.0469088kg$ | DWT is a ship's total weight excluding boiler water, measured in Imperial long tons |
| Gross Tonne (GT) | $1016.0469088kg$ | GT is a ship's area, measured in Imperial long tons |
| Nautical Mile (NM) | $1.852km$, $1,852m$ | NM is equal to 1 minute of latitude at the equator. $1NM = 1.5078 miles = 1.852km$ |
