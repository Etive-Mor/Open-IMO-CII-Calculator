# Methodology

The grading scheme for a ship's Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) is in the range A to E, where A is the most efficient bracket, and E is the least efficient. 

| Grade |  Description |
| ----- | ---- |
| A |   CII below the *Superior Boundary* |
| B |   CII above the *Superior Boundary* and below the *Lower Boundary* |
| C |   CII above the *Lower Boundary* and below the *Upper Boundary* |
| D |   CII above the *Upper Boundary* and below the *Inferior Boundary* |
| E |   CII above the *Inferior Boundary* |

Ships are split into 12 categories, including "Bulk Carrier", "Tanker", "Cruise Passenger Ship" among others. The full list can be found in [Table 1](#table-1-mepc33776---shipping-capacity-tables). A ship is compared internally among its category peers but never across categories, for example, a *Bulk Carrier* is not directly compared to a *LNG Carrier* in this system.

## Ship Grade Methodology

A ship's grade is calculated by comparing its ***Attained CII*** to its ***Required CII*** to receive its performance ratio. If the ship 's performance ratio falls below the boundary for its class of [Ship Type](#table-3-mepc33976---ship-grading-boundaries), it attains a better grade.  Boundaries are calculated as:

> $shipTypeRequiredCII \times exp(d_i)$. 

### Ship Grade Worked example
The worked example below considers a *Bulk Carrier*, with a Deadweight Tonnage below 279,000. Assuming the *Bulk Carrier*'s $required CII$ is:


> $10g CO_2 / DWT.NM$


Then the boundaries are:
 
- $10 \times exp(d1)$
- $10 \times exp(d2)$
- $10 \times exp(d3)$
- $10 \times exp(d4)$. 

$d_i$ for each ship type can be found in [Table 3](#table-3-mepc33976---ship-grading-boundaries) 

Then the resulting boundaries are:

| Boundary Type | Required CII | Boundary Calculation           |
| ------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Superior      | $= 10 \times exp(d1)$ <br /> $= 10 \times 0.86$<br />  $= 8.6$ |  $8.6 gCO_2/transportWork$ |
| Lower         | $= 10 \times exp(d2)$ <br /> $= 10 \times 0.94$<br />  $= 9.4$ |  $9.4 gCO_2/transportWork$ |
| Upper         | $= 10 \times exp(d3)$ <br /> $= 10 \times 1.06$<br />  $= 10.6$ | $10.6 gCO_2/transportWork$ |
| Inferior      | $= 10 \times exp(d4)$ <br /> $= 10 \times 1.18$<br />  $= 11.8$ | $11.8 gCO_2/transportWork$ |


Grades are then derived from these boundaries, by comparing them to the ship's *Attained CII* to the thresholds across a given calendar year:


| Grade | Higher than<br />$gCO_2/transportWork$ | Lower than <br />$gCO_2/transportWork$ | Description |
| ----- | :----: | :----: | ---- |
| A |  | 8.6 | Below *Superior Boundary* |
| B |  8.6 | 9.4 | Above *Superior Boundary*,<br />Below  *Lower Boundary* |
| C |  9.4 | 10.6 | Above *Lower Boundary*,<br />Below  *Upper Boundary* |
| D |  10.6 | 11.8 | Above *Upper Boundary*,<br />Below  *Inferior Boundary* |
| E |  11.8 | | Above *Inferior Boundary* |

For example, if the ship's *Attained CII* was $9gCO_2/transportWork$, the ship receives a grade `B`, as its *Attained CII* was above the threshold for *Superior Boundary*, but below the threshold for *Lower Boundary*.

## Ship Attained Carbon Intensity Methodology

The product of a ship's mass of $CO_2$ emissions and its $transportWork$


## Ship $CO_2$ Emissions Methodology

The sum of a ship's $CO_2$ emissions over a given year are calculated by multiplying the mass of consumed fuel by the fuel's emissions factor. 

**Method Accepts**:
- `fuelType`, an enum derrived from [Table 2](#table-2-mepc36479-mass-conversion-between-fuel-consumption-and-co_2-emissions)'s *Fuel Type* column
- `fuelConsumptionMass`, a `long` representing the mass of fuel consumed in grams (g) over the given year


**Method Returns**:

- A `decimal` representing the $M$ mass of $CO_2$ emitted by the ship across one calendar year

**Implementation**:

The sum of $CO_2$ emissions $M$ from fuel consumption in a given calendar year is 

$M = FC_j \times C_{f_j}$

Where: 
- $j$ is the fuel type
- $FC_j$ is the mass in grams of the consumed fuel type `j` in one calendar year
- $C_{f_j}$ is the fuel oil mass to CO2 mass conversion factor, given in Table 2's $C_F$ column



## Ship Capacity Methodology

A ships capacity is measured by either its Deadweight Tonnage (DWT) or Gross Tonnage (GT). The only exception is `Bulk Carriers`, which have a capacity capped at 279,000. 

To calculate a ship's Capacity in accordance with the IMO's MEPC337(76) guidelines:

**Method accepts**:
- `shipType`, an enum, derrived from *Table 1*'s *Ship Type* column
- `deadweightTonnage`, the *deadweight tonnage* of the ship, provided in long tons
- `grossTonnage`, the *gross tonnage* of the ship, provided in long tons

**Method returns**:
- a `double` representing the ship's capacity in imperial *long tons*

**Implementation**:

$Capacity$ of a given ship is calculated using the following rules:

- If the ship is a `Bulk Carrier`, and its DWT is 279,000 or above, its capacity is capped at 279,000
- If the ship is a `Bulk Carrier`, and its DWT is below 279,000, its capacity is equal to its DWT
- If the ship is a `Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)`, a `Ro-ro passenger ship` or a `Cruise passenger ship`, its capacity is equal to its Gross Tonnage
- Otherwise, the ships capacity is equal to its DWT

The full implementation detail can be found in **[Table 1](#table-1-mepc33776-shipping-capacity)**'s *Ship Type*, *Ship weight*, and *Capacity* columns.

**Exceptions**:

- `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown if the DWT is set to 0, when ship type is set to anything other than `Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)`, `Ro-ro passenger ship` or `Cruise passenger ship`
- `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown if the GT is set to 0, when ship type is set to `Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)`, `Ro-ro passenger ship` or `Cruise passenger ship`
