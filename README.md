# Open IMO Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII) Calculator ðŸš¢

## What is this?

An unofficial open source implementation of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)'s Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII). The specification for this software can be found in [IMO's resoluton MEPC.337(76)](https://wwwcdn.imo.org/localresources/en/KnowledgeCentre/IndexofIMOResolutions/MEPCDocuments/MEPC.337(76).pdf), adopted in June 2021.


# Methodology

## Ship $CO_2$ Emissions Methodology

The sum of a ship's $CO_2$ emissions over a given year are calculated by multiplying the mass of consumed fuel by the fuel's emissions factor. 

**Method Accepts**:
- `fuelType`, an enum derrived from [Table 2](#table-2-mepc36479-mass-conversion-between-fuel-consumption-and-co_2-emissions)'s *Fuel Type* column
- `fuelConsumptionMass`, a `long` representing the mass of fuel consumed in grams (g) over the given year


**Method Returns**:

- A `decimal` representing the $M$ mass of $CO_2$ emitted by the ship across one calendar year

**Implementation**:

The sum of $CO_2$ emissions $M$ from fuel consumption in a given calendar year is 

$M = FC_j \times C_{f_j}$

Where: 
- $j$ is the fuel type
- $FC_j$ is the mass in grams of the consumed fuel type `j` in one calendar year
- $C_{f_j}$ is the fuel oil mass to CO2 mass conversion factor, given in Table 2's $C_F$ column



## Ship Capacity Methodology

A ships capacity is measured by either its Deadweight Tonnage (DWT) or Gross Tonnage (GT). The only exception is `Bulk Carriers`, which have a capacity capped at 279,000. 

To calculate a ship's Capacity in accordance with the IMO's MEPC337(76) guidelines:

**Method accepts**:
- `shipType`, an enum, derrived from *Table 1*'s *Ship Type* column
- `deadweightTonnage`, the *deadweight tonnage* of the ship, provided in long tons
- `grossTonnage`, the *gross tonnage* of the ship, provided in long tons

**Method returns**:
- a `double` representing the ship's capacity in imperial *long tons*

**Implementation**:

$Capacity$ of a given ship is calculated using the following rules:

- If the ship is a `Bulk Carrier`, and its DWT is 279,000 or above, its capacity is capped at 279,000
- If the ship is a `Bulk Carrier`, and its DWT is below 279,000, its capacity is equal to its DWT
- If the ship is a `Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)`, a `Ro-ro passenger ship` or a `Cruise passenger ship`, its capacity is equal to its Gross Tonnage
- Otherwise, the ships capacity is equal to its DWT

The full implementation detail can be found in **[Table 1](#table-1-mepc33776-shipping-capacity)**'s *Ship Type*, *Ship weight*, and *Capacity* columns.

**Exceptions**:

- `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown if the DWT is set to 0, when ship type is set to anything other than `Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)`, `Ro-ro passenger ship` or `Cruise passenger ship`
- `ArgumentOutOfRangeException` is thrown if the GT is set to 0, when ship type is set to `Ro-ro cargo ship (vehicle carrier)`, `Ro-ro passenger ship` or `Cruise passenger ship`
